# Yabai Stack Navigator

A simple script to make navigating between stacks and windows in [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) easier. I wrote this as I wanted to be able to press the same keyboard shortcut to navigate between windows and stacks in Yabai and I found some options listed in [this](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/203) issue but they didn't quite do everything I wanted (specifically rotate at the end of the stacks.).
